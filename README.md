# JSON Schema for YAML VS Code Themes

JSON Schema files for VS Code themes written in YAML, with the extra features supported in projects like [Dracula for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code) and [Lucario Theme for VS Code](https://github.com/victor-gp/lucario-vscode-theme).
